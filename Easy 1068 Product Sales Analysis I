#Write a solution to report the product_name, year, and price for each sale_id in the Sales table.
Return the resulting table in any order.

# Reasoning: Product ID is a primary key for Product and present in the Sales table, thus able to be joined. 
However as sale_id is the condition on which the product details must be returned, the sale table will be the 
table product is joined on to ensure all sale_id are present.

SELECT product_name, year, price
FROM Sales s
LEFT JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
